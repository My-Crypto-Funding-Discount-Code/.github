## 🚀 What is My Crypto Funding?

My Crypto Funding — known in the community as MCF — is a crypto-native proprietary trading firm built around a bold and straightforward promise: fund serious traders with up to $400,000 in real capital, give them the best available spreads and execution conditions in the crypto prop space, and let them keep up to 100% of everything they earn. Launched with the mission of making professional crypto funding accessible to traders at every level, MCF combines the structure of a traditional prop firm evaluation with the flexibility that modern cryptocurrency traders demand — no time limits, full news trading permission, genuine weekend trading with tight spreads, and a profit split that starts at 80% and increases by 5% with every five successful payouts until it reaches 100%.

What separates MCF from the crowd is not just the 100% profit split ceiling — it is the speed at which they get there and the conditions surrounding it. While most crypto prop firms permit weekend trading in name only while charging wide spreads that make it unprofitable in practice, My Crypto Funding explicitly positions itself as the only firm in the space that enables traders to earn real weekend profits by offering the lowest fees and tightest spreads across all sessions, including Saturday and Sunday. Traders access a broad range of cryptocurrency pairs — including BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, ADA, SHIB, LINK, and more — alongside additional asset classes including forex pairs, through a platform ecosystem that now includes MetaTrader 5 and MCF's own proprietary platform fully integrated with TradingView. Account sizes run from entry-level challenges all the way to $400,000 in funded capital, with payout requests reviewed and processed within an average of just 2 hours — one of the fastest payout turnarounds of any prop firm operating in 2026 across any asset class.

## 💼 Why Choose My Crypto Funding Over Other Prop Firms?

My Crypto Funding has built a reputation as one of the most payout-fast, trader-generous, and condition-transparent crypto prop firms operating in 2026. Here is what sets it apart:

- **Up to 100% profit split — keep every dollar you earn** — MCF's profit split starts at 80% from the first funded payout and increases by 5% after every five successful withdrawals, climbing through 85%, 90%, 95%, and ultimately to 100% — meaning the most consistent performers eventually keep every single dollar of profit they generate with nothing withheld by the firm, a ceiling no traditional futures or forex prop firm comes close to matching
- **2-hour average payout processing — among the fastest of any prop firm globally** — all performance fee requests submitted by funded traders are reviewed and paid within an average of just 2 hours, a turnaround that makes MCF one of the fastest-paying prop firms operating in any asset class in 2026; payouts are processed every 15 traded days once eligibility is met, giving traders a predictable and frequent payout rhythm without calendar-locked monthly windows
- **No time limits on evaluations — trade at your own pace** — there is no maximum number of trading days during the challenge phase; traders are free to take as long as they need to complete each stage successfully without any evaluation expiry, monthly billing cycle forcing a restart, or artificial deadline pressuring faster execution of a strategy that requires patience across different market conditions
- **8% profit target with a two-phase evaluation structure** — the challenge requires reaching an 8% profit target in the first phase, with performance carrying through to the second phase in the same structured, clearly documented format; the rules are simple, transparent, and consistently enforced with no hidden conditions that surface only at the point of withdrawal
- **News trading fully permitted at all stages** — high-impact economic events and major crypto-specific announcements are freely tradeable across both the evaluation and funded phases with no mandatory flat-position windows, no pre-event buffer restrictions, and no post-event hold periods; MCF explicitly permits news trading as a documented feature of the account rather than a grey-area tolerance that varies by enforcement
- **Genuine weekend trading with lowest fees and tightest spreads** — while most crypto prop firms technically allow weekend trading, high spreads and inflated fees make it financially impractical; MCF explicitly markets itself as the only firm in the space that offers tight spreads and low fees across the full weekend session, meaning traders who hold positions or open new trades on Saturday and Sunday face the same cost structure as they do during the trading week — a genuine differentiator for swing traders and weekend macro traders
- **Weekend position holding fully permitted** — positions can be held overnight and across the full weekend at all stages of the MCF process, including during the evaluation, giving swing-oriented crypto traders the flexibility to capture multi-session moves without being forced to close flat before Friday's close
- **Broad crypto and multi-asset instrument range** — trade major and mid-cap crypto pairs including BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, ADA, SHIB, and LINK alongside forex pairs and additional asset classes, giving MCF-funded traders a wider instrument range than most crypto-only prop firms while keeping the platform's core focus firmly on cryptocurrency market conditions
- **MetaTrader 5 and proprietary TradingView-integrated platform** — traders can choose between the industry-standard MT5 interface, familiar to millions of professional traders globally, and MCF's own proprietary platform fully integrated with TradingView's charting and execution tools — a dual-platform setup that accommodates traders who prefer established infrastructure as well as those who want TradingView's advanced analytical environment
- **Up to $400,000 in funded capital** — MCF's maximum account size of $400,000 places it among the highest individual capital allocations available at any crypto prop firm in 2026, giving experienced traders access to meaningful simulated capital without needing to hold multiple accounts across different firms to reach a comparable allocation
- **Institutional-grade execution with high leverage** — funded traders access institutional-grade execution conditions with high leverage designed for professional cryptocurrency trading, giving position sizing flexibility that matches the natural volatility of the crypto markets rather than the reduced leverage caps seen at multi-asset prop firms where crypto is an afterthought
- **Zero personal risk on funded accounts** — once a trader passes the evaluation and becomes an MCF Funded Trader, they trade real capital with zero personal financial exposure; if a funded account is lost, the evaluation fee represents the total cost of the setback and traders can restart the challenge process at their discretion without liability for drawdowns on the funded account

## 🔓 Reduce Your Startup Cost with INVEST

My Crypto Funding challenges are priced competitively across the full range of account sizes, from entry-level evaluations to the $400,000 maximum funded allocation, with no hidden fees and no activation cost beyond the one-time challenge fee. With the discount code **INVEST**, you reduce that already accessible upfront cost by a further 20%, making it the most affordable legitimate entry to an 80%-to-100% progressive profit split, 2-hour average payout processing, genuine weekend trading with tight spreads, full news trading permission, and up to $400,000 in funded crypto capital available anywhere in the prop trading market today.

Lower upfront cost means less financial pressure approaching your no-time-limit evaluation, more room to trade the 8% profit target at the natural pace of your strategy across weekdays and weekends alike, and a cleaner mindset going into the funded phase — where every five payouts brings the profit split 5% closer to the 100% ceiling that the most consistent MCF traders ultimately reach.
